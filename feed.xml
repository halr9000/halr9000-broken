    "Put your face in any style" is the claim made by the authors of the paper titled:&nbsp;<a href="https://instantid.github.io/">InstantID : Zero-shot Identity-Preserving Generation in Seconds</a>. You don't have to know what this means, as the team spent a lot of time providing examples and comparisons to previous techniques. This stuff moves so fast -- I was evaluating one of them the day before writing this article, which had also been recently introduced!&nbsp;<br>
  </p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      Our model supports identity-preserving generation in high fidelity with only single reference image in any style.<br>
<br>We can achieve competitive results as LoRAs without any training.
    </blockquote>

  <p>
    Expect to see even more "face cloning" or "selfie styling" apps and services and features over the next few months. This stuff was already possible for most of a year, but you really needed many photos, careful preparation, and a lot of expensive GPU time to do it well. Not anymore. I have this running on my PC now, takes 30 seconds on my mid-range GPU.
<br>
<br>There's definitely two sides to this, as with most anything.
  </p>

  <p class="msg msg--warning">
    We are now at the point that you should not blindly trust photographic evidence without additional context or other verifiable measures!&nbsp;<br>
