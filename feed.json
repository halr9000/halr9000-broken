You don't have to know what this means, as the team spent a lot of time providing examples and comparisons to previous techniques. This stuff moves so fast -- I was evaluating one of them the day before writing this article, which had also been recently introduced!&nbsp;<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n      Our model supports identity-preserving generation in high fidelity with only single reference image in any style.<br>\n<br>We can achieve competitive results as LoRAs without any training.\n    </blockquote>\n\n  <p>\n    Expect to see even more \"face cloning\" or \"selfie styling\" apps and services and features over the next few months. This stuff was already possible for most of a year, but you really needed many photos, careful preparation, and a lot of expensive GPU time to do it well. Not anymore. I have this running on my PC now, takes 30 seconds on my mid-range GPU.\n<br>\n<br>There's definitely two sides to this, as with most anything.\n  </p>\n\n  <p class=\"msg msg--warning\">\n    We are now at the point that you should not blindly trust photographic evidence without additional context or other verifiable measures!&nbsp;<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    \n  </p>",
